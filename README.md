# Slurm RestAPI

This is a flask based rest interface to slurm.
There are two sub-packages which implement interfaces to different parts of the slurm manager
  * acctapi - interacts with the accounting database slurmdb to get job history and user associations
  * slurmapi - interactw with the pyslurm package to get queue, node, partition, and stat info

Endpoints are
```
 /users - can be filtered on user
 /history - can be filtered on offset,limit,jobid,user,partition,jobname,associd
 /queue
 /partitions
 /nodes
 /stats
 ```

### Install / Setup
Files are included to enable running the flask service under NGINX via uwsgi
 * slurmrest.ini - uwsgi ini file
 * etc/slurmrest.service - systemd service descriptor for running this service under uwsgi
 * etc/nginx_slurmrest.conf - example nginx config fragment for proxying to the uwsgi service.

To install, clone this repo somewhere like: `/opt`
```
git clone urlforgitrepo /opt
```
Then setup a virtualenv or conda env with the following:
```
conda create -p /opt/conda/envs/slurm_rest_api python=2.7
source activate /opt/conda/envs/slurm_rest_api
conda install flask
conda install -c conda-forge flask-restful flask-sqlalchemy
pip install mysql-python
pip install uwsgi
```
Make sure the uwsgi files and nginx file all point to the location of your git clone and the python evironment.
